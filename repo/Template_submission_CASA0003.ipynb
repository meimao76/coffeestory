    "Coffee is one of the most widely traded commodities in the world — but also one of the most symbolically charged. From its colonial roots in the highlands of Ethiopia to third-wave cafés in Tokyo and Istanbul, coffee travels across borders not only as a good, but as a practice, a place, and a story.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project examines coffee as both a global flow and a local habit, exploring how trade, branding, and urban life intersect in and through this everyday object. On the international scale, coffee reveals the inequalities embedded in value chains, where production often occurs in the Global South, while most value is captured by corporate branding and consumption in the North (Gereffi et al., 2005). Yet beyond trade, coffee also mediates practices of identity, aspiration, and social differentiation in cities — what Warde (2005) calls “practice systems,” enacted through daily routines and spatial habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our website depicts this multi-scale geography through a series of interactive visualisations. We incorporate 3D trade flows, value chain breakdowns, and city cafe map comparisons to tell a story from the macrosystem to the micro space. Guided by theories of consumer culture (Arnould & Thompson, 2005) and informal public life (Oldenburg, 2023), we explore where global coffee flows, who benefits from its flow, and how it is lived, shaped, and visibled in urban forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using data-driven narratives, scroll-based staging, and spatialised POI networks, we map not just the movement of coffee but also what it reveals about modern urban life."

    "In this section, we use D3.js and Globe.gl to bring our data to life. D3.js powers the histograms and Sankey diagrams, while Globe.gl creates a 3D interactive globe that lets users explore global coffee trade flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we see that most raw coffee is grown in Global-South countries—Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, and others—while the biggest importers are in the Global-North, especially the United States, Europe, and Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show how coffee beans move, we built an animated “fly-line” map. It reveals, for example, that Colombian beans mostly go to the U.S., Indonesian beans feed European markets, and Brazil supplies both regions. Once those green beans arrive in consuming countries, they’re roasted and turned into products (think Nestlé or Lavazza). Those finished goods then either stay local or move on to neighboring markets—Germany to France, the U.S. to Canada, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting pattern appears when you zoom in on European trade data: some countries import a flood of green beans but then export a hefty batch of roasted coffee. That tells you immediately who’s built a robust coffee-processing industry. And here’s a neat detail: roasted beans weigh less than their unroasted counterparts but sell for much more per kilogram, showing that roasting and branding are where the real extra value lies."

    "The Global Value Chain (GVC) framework shows how every step—from growing and processing to roasting and retail—adds value to a product. But the gains aren’t shared equally. In coffee, most of the profit sits with roasters, distributors, and big brands, while farmers see only a tiny slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this clear, we created a Sankey diagram tracking how the price of one cup of coffee in Germany is split across Brazil’s and Colombia’s value chains. Hover over each flow to see volume and cash direction. The underlying study found that only about 4% of what you pay reaches the farm. On average, a farmer gets around €0.41 per kilogram of green beans, while the rest of your money goes to roasters, manufacturers, retailers—and hefty VAT and other taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This uneven split highlights a core challenge of GVCs: without fair-trade schemes, cooperatives, or other interventions, farmers remain locked into low-margin stages. They supply raw materials but lack the capital, technology, and market access to move “up the chain” into processing or branding—where the juicy profits hide."

    "Bourdieu’s symbolic capital theory tells us that prestige and social recognition—what he calls “symbolic capital”—are just as valuable as money. It’s not just owning a fancy watch or driving a jet; even something as ordinary as a cup of coffee can carry status.\n",
    "\n",
    "We built an interactive chart showing coffee habits around the world. You can switch between total national consumption and per capita figures, and compare multiple countries at once. The U.S. leads in overall consumption, with Brazil in second—largely thanks to their big populations. But on a per-person basis the picture flips: Luxembourg tops the list at about 5.3 cups per person per day (or roughly 22 kg per year). Meanwhile, Denmark has the highest average price per cup at around $5.40—most of the priciest markets are in developed countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, on our globe view we plotted where big coffee chains got their start. Almost all the heavy hitters—Starbucks from the U.S., Costa Coffee from the U.K., Tim Hortons from Canada—hail from Global North countries. They now operate tens of thousands of cafés worldwide. Coffee-producing nations rarely create brands of similar scale. Even when they do, their café networks tend to be small and local.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Consumer Culture Theory (Arnould & Thompson, 2005), consumption is a key way people build and express identity. In many developed cities, coffee shops are associated with “creative professionals” and “white-collar” lifestyles. In most producing countries, however, coffee is still seen mainly as a basic drink or export crop—not yet a symbol of urban culture or social prestige. On top of that, lower disposable incomes, less urban infrastructure, and fewer specialty cafés make it harder for local consumers to join the high-end coffee scene. All of this keeps per-capita consumption in the Global South well below Global-North levels.\n"
