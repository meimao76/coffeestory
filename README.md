This serves as the main entry point, presenting interactive modules on global coffee trade, value chains, and urban café cultures.

## Data Overview

* The `data/` folder contains the **spatial datasets** used in the project, including point-of-interest (POI) data, administrative boundaries, and café chain locations.
* Some map layers (e.g., basemaps and heatmaps) are hosted externally on **Mapbox** and loaded via API during runtime.

## GitHub Access

All project files and datasets are also accessible via our GitHub repository:

[https://github.com/meimao76/coffeestory](https://github.com/meimao76/coffeestory)

* Frontend code, scripts, and map logic are fully open source.
* Data files can be explored or downloaded from the `data/` directory.

## Project Description

This project explores coffee as both a **global commodity** and a **cultural practice**, tracing its journey from production origins to consumption landscapes. Through interactive storytelling, we highlight economic inequalities, value chains, and the local rhythms of café life in cities like Tokyo and Istanbul.
